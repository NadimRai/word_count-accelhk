Accelerate Bootcamp

This is week 1 BDD with Ruby independent Project 'Word Count'.
Students are asked to create a website that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should be able to input both the word and the string of words to check. 
You’ll need to account for case sensitivity (“HI” isn’t the same as “hi”) and punctuation (“hi” isn’t the same as “hi!”)

Ruby Gems used for the project:
  Sinatra
  Rspec
  
Please type ruby app.rb from root folder to view the app.
